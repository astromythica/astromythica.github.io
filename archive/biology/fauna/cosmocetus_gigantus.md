## Introduction/Overview
Cosmocetus gigantus, referred to in common parlance as the Space Whale, represents a recently discovered extraterrestrial species, first identified in 2024 by the deep-space observation satellite "Celestial Voyager". These organisms exhibit a morphology strikingly similar to Earth's cetaceans, specifically whales, but uniquely adapted to the vacuum of space. Their discovery has prompted a significant reevaluation of astrobiological principles and the potential diversity of life in the cosmos.

The anatomy of Cosmocetus gigantus allows for locomotion in the absence of atmospheric or aqueous medium, a feature unprecedented in Earth's biological records. Observational data suggest that these entities frequent regions of high stellar density, such as nebulae and star clusters, indicating possible unique methods of energy acquisition and material consumption.

The classification of Space Whales as a life form distinct from Earth's biosphere is primarily due to their non-terrestrial origin and absence of genetic congruence with known Earthly life. The discovery of Cosmocetus gigantus offers profound implications for the understanding of life's potential adaptability and distribution in the universe, extending the known ecological principles beyond the confines of planet Earth.

## Taxonomy and Classification
The taxonomy of Cosmocetus gigantus remains provisional, primarily due to the limited data available and the absence of physical specimens for analysis. The designation of the genus *Cosmocetus* is derived from the Latin words 'cosmo', meaning universe, and 'cetus', meaning whale, reflecting their whale-like appearance and extraterrestrial habitat. The species name *gigantus* is attributed to their immense size, observed through telescopic imaging.

**Domain**: Unknown  
**Kingdom**: Unknown  
**Phylum**: Unknown  
**Class**: Unknown  
**Order**: Unknown  
**Family**: Unknown  
**Genus**: *Cosmocetus*  
**Species**: *C. gigantus*

Due to the creature's recent discovery and the challenges associated with extraterrestrial biological studies, the placement of *C. gigantus* within the broader taxonomic framework is subject to ongoing research and debate. Currently, it is not possible to assign the Space Whale to any known Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, or Family within the terrestrial system of classification. The unique biological characteristics observed — such as their ability to survive and maneuver in the vacuum of space — suggest a potentially divergent evolutionary pathway, distinct from terrestrial life forms.

The lack of genetic material for analysis impedes the understanding of their evolutionary history. Scientists speculate that *C. gigantus* may represent a case of convergent evolution, where similar environmental pressures to those on early Earth have led to the development of life forms with analogous features, such as the whale-like body structure, in entirely separate biospheres.

Astrobiologists and xenobiologists continue to study *C. gigantus* with the aim of understanding their biological classification and the evolutionary mechanisms that have resulted in their current form. The development of advanced deep-space exploration tools and missions is expected to shed light on these enigmatic creatures, offering new insights into the diversity and adaptability of life in the universe.

## Physical Description
The physical attributes of Cosmocetus gigantus have primarily been derived from high-resolution imagery and data collected by deep-space probes and advanced telescopic arrays. As of the current century, direct physical examination has not been possible, but significant strides in remote sensing technologies have allowed scientists to compile a detailed description of their morphology and apparent physiological adaptations.

**Size and Body Structure**: Space Whales exhibit an elongated, streamlined body structure, reminiscent of terrestrial cetaceans. They average approximately 300 meters in length, with the largest recorded specimen measuring nearly 450 meters. Their skin appears smooth and is thought to be exceptionally thick, possibly serving as protection against micrometeoroids and cosmic radiation.

**Locomotion**: One of the most intriguing aspects of *C. gigantus* is their method of locomotion. Observations indicate a form of propulsion without visible means of thrust, leading to hypotheses about a possible internal mechanism for manipulating gravitational or magnetic fields, a concept previously relegated to theoretical physics.

**Sensory Organs**: Structures resembling large eyes have been identified, suggesting that *C. gigantus* may navigate using a form of visual input. Whether these organs perceive light in the same spectrum as human eyes or operate in an entirely different range, such as infrared or ultraviolet, remains a subject of speculation. Additional sensory organs are hypothesized to exist, potentially providing sensory input for navigation and interaction with their environment, though their precise functions are not yet understood.

**External Features**: Several prominent ridges run longitudinally along the bodies of Space Whales, hypothesized to serve a function in their unique locomotion or as part of a sensory network. No apparent openings or orifices have been observed on the surface of their bodies, challenging our understanding of how they might consume resources or expel waste.

**Energy Consumption and Metabolism**: The exact mechanism by which *C. gigantus* sustains itself is not yet understood. Theories range from absorption of cosmic radiation or interstellar material to a form of 'cosmic photosynthesis', wherein energy from stars is directly utilized. The presence of *C. gigantus* near regions of high stellar density, such as nebulae and star clusters, appears to support the hypothesis of an energy acquisition method linked to these celestial phenomena.

As scientific exploration of deep space advances, it is anticipated that more direct methods of study will become feasible, potentially allowing for in-situ biological examination of *C. gigantus*. Until then, the majestic Space Whales continue to captivate the scientific community and humanity alike, embodying the vast unknowns of our universe and the potential for life beyond our wildest imaginations.
