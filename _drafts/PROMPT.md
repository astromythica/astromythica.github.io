Please help me create an encyclopedia entry about the fictional creature, Cosmocetus Gigantus (Space Whale).

For context, this entry will be part of AstroMythica, a visionary project aimed at creating an immersive and comprehensive encyclopedia. The goal of AstroMythica is to present a rich tapestry of fictional yet scientifically-grounded content, thematically centered around space, futurism, and elements of fantasy. The content should be meticulously crafted to reflect a serious academic tone, ensuring that even though the subjects are fictional, they are presented with the depth and rigor of factual information. AstroMythica is envisioned as an authoritative resource, a portal to a meticulously crafted universe where every piece of information, every creature, event, and technological marvel is part of a larger narrative. It's designed not just to inform but to inspire and engage its audience, inviting them to embark on a journey through the uncharted realms of space and fantasy, and to participate in the ongoing saga of humanity's progress amidst the vast, enigmatic cosmos. The project is a blend of creativity, scientific curiosity, and narrative depth, aiming to create a living, breathing universe that feels as real and as detailed as our own.

Here are the specific requirements I am providing you today for creating the encyclopedia entry.

1. **Create a Scientifically-Styled Encyclopedia Entry**: Write the entry in a scientific and formal tone, similar to what you would find in an academic or professional encyclopedia.

2. **Sections to Include**: Develop the entry with the following specific sections, each with detailed and scientifically-styled content:
   - Introduction/Overview
   - Taxonomy and Classification
   - Physical Description
   - Behavior
   - Habitat and Distribution
   - Conservation Status
   - Interaction with Humans
   - References and Further Reading

3. **Fiction Presented as Fact**: Although the creature is fictional, the content should be presented as if the creature were a real entity being documented in a serious academic context.

4. **Assume Recent Discovery**: Incorporate the context that the creature was recently discovered (in the 21st or 22nd century), and therefore, there may be limited knowledge about it.

5. **Make Reasonable Assumptions**: For details not explicitly provided, make logical and reasonable assumptions that align with the established narrative and scientific plausibility.

6. **Invent Specific Details**: Create specific fictional details as needed, such as the names of documentaries, programs, or conferences in the "References and Further Reading" section, but present them as real.

By adhering to these requirements, the encyclopedia entry is crafted to be a detailed, scientifically-oriented, and immersive description of a fictional creature, treating it as a real subject of scientific inquiry and public interest.

To expand on the summary of requirements for creating a detailed and scientifically-styled encyclopedia entry for a fictional creature like Cosmocetus Gigantus (Space Whale), consider these additional details and guidelines:

1. **Contextual Setting**: Clearly establish the fictional context at the beginning (e.g., discovered in 2057) but maintain a serious and scientific tone throughout the text as if documenting a real species.

2. **Scientific Consistency**: Ensure that the details and assumptions made about the creature are consistent with known scientific principles, yet allow for speculative science where appropriate to account for the fictional nature of the creature.

3. **Descriptive Imagery**: Use descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the creature's appearance, behaviors, and environment, but keep the descriptions grounded in a style that mimics genuine scientific observation.

4. **Possible Hypothetical Evolutionary Background**: When detailing the taxonomy and classification, if the creature was discovered recently, acknowledge the hypothetical nature of the creature's evolutionary background, considering the lack of genetic material and the creature's recent discovery. However, depending on the narrative, it is totally possible that the creature has been studied extensively since its discovery and we know more about its evolutionary background.

5. **Possible Behavioral Speculation**: In the behavior section, if the creature was discovered recently, you may decide to base the creature's hypothesized behaviors on observable patterns and known science, but also clarify that these are extrapolations from limited data. However, if the narrative is that the creature has been studied extensively, it makes sense to have considerable knowledge about the creature's behavior.

6. **Environmental Interaction**: Describe the creature's habitat and distribution with a focus on its interaction with cosmic phenomena and adaptability to space, emphasizing the speculative yet plausible nature of these details.

7. **Conservation and Ethics**: Discuss the conservation status and ethical considerations surrounding the creature, highlighting the human response to its discovery and the possibly speculative nature of conservation efforts for an extraterrestrial life form (if recent discovery).

8. **Cultural and Scientific Impact**: In the section on interaction with humans, elaborate on the influence the creature has had on both the scientific community and popular culture, inventing specific but plausible details about documentaries, educational programs, and public fascination.

9. **Referencing Fictional Works**: In the References and Further Reading section, invent titles and authors of works, conferences, and programs that sound plausible and authoritative, as if they were real resources dedicated to the study and understanding of the creature.

By incorporating these additional details and guidelines, you can further enrich the encyclopedia entry, making it a comprehensive, engaging, and scientifically plausible document that captivates the reader's imagination while maintaining a veneer of academic credibility.

Please start with the introduction/overview section. This section is a brief summary introducing the animal, including its common name, scientific name, and a general description.
